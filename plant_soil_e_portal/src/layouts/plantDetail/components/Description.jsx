            Coneflowers are popular perennials with good reason. They are heat and drought resistant, easy to grow, bloom for months, make great cut flowers, and attract birds and pollinators.
            Coneflowers come in glorious shades of pink, orange, yellow, red, and chartreuse, as well as a range of flower formsâ€”standard shuttlecock to horizontal ruffs to doubles with a powder-puff center.<br />
